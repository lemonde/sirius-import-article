  Do you know that when you deploy your React application which is created using
  𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲-𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗰𝘁-𝗮𝗽𝗽 or your own webpack configuration to a live website like
  Netlify, Vercel, Heroku etc, your entire source code is visible to everyone
  from the sources tab of the developer toolbar as shown in the screenshot of
  this post.

  This is not an issue with the 𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲-𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗰𝘁-𝗮𝗽𝗽 but all of the source code is
  added because of the source map
</p>
<p>😲😲😲</p>
<p>
  But you definitely don't want everyone to see your entire source code If it's
  a private repository or you're working on a client project.
</p>
<p>There is an easy way to fix it.</p>
<p>
  Create a file with the name .env in your project folder with the below code
  inside it
</p>
<p><code>GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false</code></p>
<p>
  so when you run 𝗻𝗽𝗺 𝗿𝘂𝗻 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 or 𝘆𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗿𝘂𝗻 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 command from the terminal,
</p>
<p>
  It will generate a 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 folder with minified files without a source map that
  you can deploy to the production.
